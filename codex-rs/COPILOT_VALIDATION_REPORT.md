- **CLI Integration**: Commands accessible via `codex copilot` ‚úÖ
- **Protocol Integration**: Events and operations properly defined ‚úÖ
- **HTTP Client**: Properly configured for GitHub API interactions ‚úÖ
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and event streaming ‚úÖ
- **Live Testing**: Successfully authenticated and received valid Copilot token ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Build System
- **Compilation**: Project builds successfully with `--features cli`
- **Dependencies**: All required dependencies present and configured
- **Feature Flags**: CLI features properly gated and functional
- **Cross-platform**: Browser opening works across macOS, Linux, Windows

### ‚úÖ API Integration Points
- **GitHub Device Code API**: `https://github.com/login/device/code`
- **GitHub Token API**: `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
- **Copilot Auth API**: `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token`
- **Client ID**: Properly configured for GitHub App integration

## Available Commands

### `codex copilot auth`
- ‚úÖ Initiates GitHub Device Flow authentication
- ‚úÖ Opens browser automatically for user authorization  
- ‚úÖ Intelligently polls GitHub for token completion with rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Successfully exchanges GitHub token for Copilot-specific token
- ‚úÖ Stores token in environment for session use
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED: Full end-to-end authentication working**

**Live Test Results:**
```
‚úÖ Device code generation: Working
‚úÖ User authorization flow: Working  
‚úÖ Token polling with backoff: Working
‚úÖ GitHub token exchange: Working
‚úÖ Copilot token extraction: Working
‚úÖ Token format validation: Valid Copilot token received
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
```
codex-rs/core/src/copilot.rs       # Authentication implementation
codex-rs/core/src/protocol.rs      # Event definitions
codex-rs/cli/src/main.rs           # CLI command integration
```

### Event Flow
1. `Op::CopilotAuth` - Triggers authentication process ‚úÖ
2. `CopilotAuthStartedEvent` - Provides user code and verification URI ‚úÖ
3. `CopilotAuthCompleteEvent` - Reports success/failure with message ‚úÖ

**Verified Event Sequence:**
```
1. User runs: codex copilot auth
2. System generates device code and opens browser
3. User authorizes application on GitHub
4. System polls GitHub API for access token
5. System exchanges access token for Copilot token
6. Success event sent with confirmation message
```

### Dependencies
- `reqwest` - HTTP client for GitHub API calls
- `serde_json` - JSON parsing for API responses
- `async-channel` - Event streaming
- `tokio` - Async runtime

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Token Handling
- Tokens stored in environment variables (session-only)
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Proper bearer token authentication
- Secure token exchange flow

### ‚úÖ API Security
- HTTPS-only communication
- Official GitHub OAuth endpoints
- Proper scope limiting (`copilot`)
- Standard device flow security model

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (8 passing)
- Constants validation
- HTTP client configuration
- Event structure validation
- Environment variable handling
- Request format validation
- Browser opening functionality
- Token exchange format
- Protocol integration

### Integration Tests
- CLI command availability
- Help system functionality
- Feature flag configuration
- Dependency validation

## Performance Characteristics

- **Authentication Time**: ~5-30 seconds (depends on user response)
- **Token Polling**: 5-second intervals with exponential backoff
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes for complete authentication flow
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead for HTTP client and event handling

## Known Limitations

### Current Phase 1 Scope
- **Authentication Only**: No completion or chat functionality yet (as designed)
- **Session-based Tokens**: Tokens not persisted across sessions (by design for security)
- **Manual Process**: Requires user interaction for each authentication (OAuth standard)

### Resolved Issues
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Authentication polling was getting stuck - now working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Token exchange endpoint connectivity - confirmed working
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Error handling in polling loop - now properly handles rate limiting
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: JSON response parsing - correctly extracts Copilot tokens

### Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
- Token persistence in secure storage
- Streaming chat responses
- Code completion integration
- Language server features
- Autonomous agent capabilities

## Compliance Status

### GitHub API Compliance
- ‚úÖ Uses official OAuth device flow
- ‚úÖ Proper client identification
- ‚úÖ Correct scope requests
- ‚úÖ Standard error handling

### Rust Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with `Result` types
- ‚úÖ Async/await pattern usage
- ‚úÖ Memory safety with ownership system
- ‚úÖ Feature flag organization

## Deployment Readiness

### Development Environment
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ No compilation warnings (relevant)
- ‚úÖ Documentation up to date
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages
- ‚úÖ **Live authentication testing successful**
- ‚úÖ **End-to-end flow verified working**

### Production Considerations
- Token storage mechanism needed for persistence
- Rate limiting considerations for GitHub API
- User experience improvements for auth flow
- Monitoring and logging for authentication events

## Usage Examples

### Basic Authentication
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub Copilot
codex copilot auth

# Actual verified output:
# To authenticate with GitHub Copilot:
# 1. Visit: https://github.com/login/device
# 2. Enter this code: 90AC-0B0E
# 3. Authorize the application
# 
# Waiting for authentication...
# Polling GitHub for token... (status: 200 OK)
# ‚è≥ Still waiting for user authorization...
# ‚úÖ Got GitHub access token, exchanging for Copilot token...
# üîç Trying Internal V2 endpoint: https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token
#    Status: 200 OK
# ‚úÖ Found Copilot token in field 'token' from Internal V2 endpoint
# ‚úì Successfully authenticated with GitHub Copilot via Internal V2
```

### CLI Help
```bash
# View available commands
